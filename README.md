# JobPositionsAndSafety-Assignment3

In this program, I focused on using the API from the USA jobs website, and scrapped the MPA (Mortgage Professional America) in order to create a program that asks the user for a job title, and returns a csv file containing the job position, organization name, city, and state in the USA using the API from the USA jobs website, and also tell us whether its in one of the top 15 safest  USA states or not. 

I chose this website primarily because it had the data I needed to add that extra element to my program, and also because it follows a pretty simple HTML format. All the data I needed was strictly in the <h3> format. 

I think this combination of jobs and whether the location is safe is not as common. Usually you would find factors such as salary and location as top things to associate the job with because of course they are essential. But sometimes we forget to consider how important it is to work in a safe state, and this program achieves that.
