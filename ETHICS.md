# Purpose of data collection

The reason why we are collecting data in this code is in order to use the API from the USA jobs website, and scrapped the MPA (Mortgage Professional America) in order to create a program that asks the user for a job title, and returns a csv file containing the job position, organization name, city, and state in the USA using the API from the USA jobs website, and also tell us whether its in one of the top 15 safest USA states or not.
Ethics & Respecting the Site policies:
Both websites use for the API and the web scrapping do not include a robots file to check if I am violating any of their rules, so I decided to skim through their websites and see what it mentions on the topic of ethics of scrapping and just using their data in general. 

As for the website they do not mention anything about restricting web scrapping but they do have an issue with scraping data or using it for advertising which is not the case in my program. Besides that, the terms and conditions touch on web scraping of unpublished or confidential content, but the blog I used was a publicly accessible published and updates blog, so there is not an issue with that either.

As for the website I am using for the API, they did not mention anything about using the API either, but their main concern was to not edit or modify or delete any of the data and that was  mentioned in their terms and conditions.
